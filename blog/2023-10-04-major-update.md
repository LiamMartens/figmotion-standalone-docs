## Introducing version history and paid plans ðŸŽ‰
Figmotion was first introduced on the day Figma made plugins publicly available in 2020.
At that time, it was a very rudimentary animation plugin that simply got the job done, no more.

However, to this day, the vision of Figmotion still stands, which is to allow anyone to learn keyframe-based animation tooling and make it accessible to all platformsâ€”no need for a powerful machine or a Macbook Pro.

This is also why I initially set out to create Figmotion. I was and still am a Linux user, and there were no easy ways to create quick and easy animations on Linux.
Figma opened up the world of UX and UI design to me, and I set out to do the same with Figmotion for animation.

Since then, countless hours have been spent developing Figmotion. It is a passion project on which I have spent many days, weeks, and months, and today marks a huge day for me and for Figmotion.

I am officially introducing 2 paid plans for Figmotion, but don't worry all, existing features will still be available as is. The paid plans (Standard & Professional) come with specific new features such as priority rendering, version history, variable support, and a higher GIF resolution. Both plans will also receive more advanced features in the future.

You can check out the new plans in Figmotion by going to *File > Upgrade Plan* or you can check out the [homepage](https://figmotion.app)  

## Other new features
Additionally, this release also comes with some exciting new features for the everyone.

### Translate X and Y properties
These new properties allow you to animate layers relatively to their initial position instead of using "absolute positioning". This can be useful for entry and exit animations.

### Text content property
*Only supported in single font text layers*  
This new property makes it easy to create "typing text" animations. It can even make use of easing to vary the typing speed.

### Item spacing & padding properties
These new properties make it possible to animate the item spacing and padding of auto-layout frames.

### Figma preview panel
This new panel allows you to preview your design inside of Figmotion if you are not using the windows side-by-side or if you are exclusively using the timeline window.
