# Letter spacing
![Letter spacing](./img/letter-spacing/letter-spacing.jpg)  

### Notes
> Letter spacing does not currently consider the anchor point. This means it will always grow from the left.

> Lottie export does not currently support letter spacing animation due to the limited text support.
