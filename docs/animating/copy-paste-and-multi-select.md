# Copy, paste and multi-select
## Copy and paste
It is possible to copy and paste keyframes using `CMD/CTRL+C/V`. When pasting, the previously copied keyframes, will be pasted at the current timehandle position.

You may also notice the copied data is simply a JSON representation of your animation. This means you can also easily share your animation data with someone else by simply copying it.

## Using multi-select
It is possible to select more than one keyframe at a time. There are 2 ways of doing so: 

1. Simply hold `Shift` when selecting each keyframe. As long as you hold shift, the keyframe will be added to your selection.
2. You can drag your cursor anywhere in the timeline window to start selecting keyframes. A blue box will appear to visualize your selection area.
