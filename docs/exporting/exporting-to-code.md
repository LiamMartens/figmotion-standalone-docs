# Exporting to code
It is also possible to export your animation to code. This can be either as `CSS`, `JSON` or `Lottie`

## CSS and JSON
Both of these formats simply provide the basic information needed to implement the animation. It will contain the easing information, timings and values however they will still need to be interpreted by a developer to implement into the final project.

## Lottie (beta)
This will export a Lottie file which can be directly imported into a lottie player. This is currently a beta feature and may contain bugs.
